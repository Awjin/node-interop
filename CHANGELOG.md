  `ReadableStream<T>`, `WritableStream<T>` and `NodeIOSink`.
- Added implementations of server side `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse`
  to `http.dart`, as well some other objects like `HttpHeaders`.
- Added `dartifyError(JsError error)` to the main library which converts
  from JS `Error` instances in to Dart's equivalent.
- Implemented more methods in `File`: `openRead`, `openWrite`, `readAsBytes`.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

- **Breaking changes:**
  - `NodePlatform` is no longer exported from `node_interop.dart` library.
  - Library-level `exports` getter was removed. Now  `exports` is a direct reference
    to native JS object. Replace any calls to `exports.setProperty(name, value)`
    with new API: `node.export(name, value)`.
  - "http" module: `Agent`, `Server`, `AgentOptions` renamed to
    `HttpAgent`, `HttpServer`, `HttpAgentOptions` respectively.
  - "http" module: `createAgent` renamed to `createHttpAgent`.
  - `node_interop/bindings.dart` was removed. All bindings are available
    through main `node_interop/node_interop.dart` import.
- **New:**
  - Many updates to documentation.
  - Main package's library now exposes all (implemented) Node API bindings.
  - New `node` library object with centralized access to the Node platform and
    runtime information, as well as module globals like `require` and `exports`.
  - Exposed parts of "https", "tls", "dns" and "net" module bindings.
  - Added HTTPS support to `NodeClient` from `node_interop/http.dart`.
  - Updated examples.
  - Gitter channel is now up: https://gitter.im/pulyaevskiy/node-interop.
