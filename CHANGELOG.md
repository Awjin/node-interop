# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- **Breaking changes:**
  - `NodePlatform` is no longer exported from `node_interop.dart` library.
  - Library-level `exports` getter was removed. Now  `exports` is a direct reference
    to native JS object. Replace any calls to `exports.setProperty(name, value)`
    with new API: `node.export(name, value)`.
- **Deprecated:**
  - `node_interop/bindings.dart` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.2.0.
    All bindings are available through main `node_interop/node_interop.dart`
    import.
- **New:**
  - Many updates to documentation.
  - Main package's library now exposes all (implemented) Node API bindings.
  - New `node` library object with centralized access to the Node platform and
    runtime information, which also exposes helpers for `require` and `exports`.
  - Exposed parts of "dns" and "net" module bindings.
  - Gitter channel is now up: https://gitter.im/pulyaevskiy/node-interop.
