/// NodeJS interop library.
///
/// Provides interface definitions for NodeJS APIs and allows writing Dart
/// applications and libraries which can be compiled and used in NodeJS.
///
/// Some APIs, like 'fs' and 'http' Node modules must be `require`d to use, e.g.:
///
///     FS nodeFS = require('fs');
///     HTTP nodeHTTP = require('http');
///
/// This library also exposes [node] object which provides centralized access to
/// Node's runtime and platform information, as well as some convenience methods
/// for `require` and `exports`.
///
/// See also:
/// - [HTTP]
/// - [FS]
/// - [ChildProcessModule]
