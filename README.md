## What is this?

`node_interop` provides NodeJS API bindings and enables running Dart
applications in NodeJS.

In addition to bindings some modules are also exposed as idiomatic Dart
libraries. For instance, in addition to Node's [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
module bindings this package provides a HTTP client implementation
based on Dart's [http](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/http) package.

Here is an example app using this client:

```dart
import 'package:node_interop/http.dart';

void main() async {
  var http = new NodeClient();
  var response = await http.get('https://example.com');
  print("Response code: ${response.statusCode}.");
  http.close(); // close any open IO connections.
}
```

There is not much Node or JS specific about this app, it looks like a
regular Dart app. This is pretty much why `node_interop` exists.

## Examples

Checkout `example/` folder of this repository for some example
apps using different APIs.

## Status

This package is under active development which means things are likely to
change rather rapidly.

Make sure to checkout [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for every release, all
notable changes and upgrade instructions will be announced there.

If you found a bug, please don't hesitate to create an issue in the
[issue tracker](http://github.com/pulyaevskiy/node-interop/issues/new).

## Usage

How to create a simple Node app written in Dart:

1. Create a new Dart project. [Stagehand](http://stagehand.pub) is a great way
  to scaffold all the boilerplate:
  ```bash
  $ pub global activate stagehand
  $ mkdir my_node_app
  $ cd my_node_app
  $ stagehand package-simple # if you have .pub-cache in your PATH, or
  $ pub global run stagehand package-simple # if you don't have it in your PATH
  ```
2. Add dependency and transformers to the generated `pubspec.yaml`
  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    node_interop: ^0.1.0

  transformers:
    - $dart2js
    - node_interop # <- must go after dart2js!
  ```
3. Create `node/main.dart` and write some code:
  ```dart
  import 'package:node_interop/fs.dart';

  void main() async {
    var fs = new NodeFileSystem(); // access Node `fs` module
    print(fs.currentDirectory); // prints the path from `process.cwd()`
    var files = await fs.currentDirectory.list().toList();
    print(files); // lists current directory contents
  }
  ```
4. **Compile.**
  Tell Pub to build `node/` folder:
  ```bash
  $ pub build node/
  ```
5. **Run the app.** Compiled app is located in `build/node/main.dart.js`:
  ```bash
  $ # assuming you have NodeJS installed:
  $ node build/bin/main.dart.js
  $ # If everything worked well you should see your current
  $ # directory contents printed out.
  ```

## Libraries

This package consists of a set of libraries.

### Node Interop

> `import 'package:node_interop/node_interop.dart'`.

Main library which provides NodeJS API bindings as-is. Not all of the APIs are
implemented at this point, in fact, it's a small percentage. If you didn't find
a class or method you were looking for, please create an issue or submit a
pull request (even better!).

You have to explicitly `require` a Node module which declares an API you want
to use. Refer to dartdoc for more details. Here is an example if using
bindings directly:

```dart
import 'package:node_interop/node_interop.dart';

void main() {
  // Require specific modules:
  FS nodeFS = require('fs');
  OS nodeOS = require('os');
  // Use globals:
  console.log('message');
}
```

Note that bindings provide direct access to JavaScript objects and functions and
you still need to make sure Dart/JS object a converted properly as well as
Dart functions are wrapped with `allowInterop` when passed to JS.

### FS

> `import 'package:node_interop/fs.dart'`.

Exposes Node's file system API as a set of Dart classes compatible with
interfaces from "dart:io" (in particular it implements interfaces provided by
the [file](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/file) package).

_Note that not all methods are currently implemented for `File` and `Directory`
classes._

### HTTP

> `import 'package:node_interop/http.dart'`.

Implements Dart-style HTTP client using [http](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/file)
package interface.

## Pub transformer

This library provides Pub transformer which by default processes all `.dart`
files. The only thing it does is it prepends Node preamble to JS generated by
dart2js transformer.

## NodeJS modules and `exports`

It is possible to create a module which exposes some functionality via NodeJS
`exports`.

Here is simple module example exporting a `bang` function:

```dart
// file:bin/bang.dart
import 'package:node_interop/node_interop.dart';

/// A module which exports a bang function.
void main() {
  exports.setProperty('bang', bang);
}

String bang(String value) {
  return value.toUpperCase() + '!';
}
```

After compiled with `pub build` it can be `require`d from any JS file:

```js
const bang = require('path/to/build/bin/bang.dart.js');
console.log(bang.bang('Hi'));
// prints out "HI!"
```

> For such a small function the resulting `bang.dart.js` would be quite
> large (~1k lines of code). However creating Node modules like this can
> be considered an edge use case when you would want to mix in some
> functionality from Dart into an existing Node app.
